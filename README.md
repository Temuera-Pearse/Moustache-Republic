# Welcome
im about to attempt this tech challenge. its my second ever tech challenge and so i've decided to spend 5 hours in total trying to get as far as possible. 1 hour planning then break then 2 hours coding, break then the last 2 hours. 

the commit i do next will mark the start of the planning phase (ill call it 'planning phase').

#Planning Phase

Need to make what looks to be a e commerce type app. i have some excercises from dev academy i can look into as we did something along those lines. They were in redux though and i kinda want to react-query for this one.
